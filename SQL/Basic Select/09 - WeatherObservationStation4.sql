-- Problem Statement
/*
Given a table STATION that holds data for five fields; ID, CITY, STATE, LAT_N and LONG_W.
+-------------+-------------+
| Field       |   Type      |
+-------------+-------------+
| ID          | NUMBER      |
| CITY        | VARCHAR2(21)|
| STATE       | VARCHAR2(2) |
| LAT_N       | NUMBER      |
| LONG_W      | NUMBER      |
+-------------+-------------+

Let N be the number of CITY entries in STATION, and let N' be the number of distinct CITY names in STATION; query the value of N-N' from STATION. In other words, find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.
*/

-- Solution

SELECT COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) FROM STATION;
