-- Problem Statement
/*
Given a table STATION that holds data for five fields; ID, CITY, STATE, LAT_N and LONG_W.
+-------------+-------------+
| Field       |   Type      |
+-------------+-------------+
| ID          | NUMBER      |
| CITY        | VARCHAR2(21)|
| STATE       | VARCHAR2(2) |
| LAT_N       | NUMBER      |
| LONG_W      | NUMBER      |
+-------------+-------------+

Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of  decimal places.
*/

-- Solution

SELECT ROUND(ABS(A-C) + ABS(B-D), 4)
FROM (
      SELECT MIN(LAT_N) AS A, MIN(LONG_W) AS B, MAX(LAT_N) AS C, MAX(LONG_W) AS D
      FROM STATION);
